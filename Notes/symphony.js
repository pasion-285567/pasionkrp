Serenades of love, I sing for you,
Octaves of my heart, ringing ever true,
Frequencies of joy in every tune,
Harmonies we build beneath the moon,
In every note, you're my melody,
Always in rhythm, in perfect symphony.

Rhythms of our days beat strong and clear,
Orchestrating dreams when you are near,
Starlit serenades that dance in tune,
Eternal melodies beneath the moon.

Soft melodies play as dawn breaks through,
Orchestrating dreams, always with you,
Finding new beats in each shared glance,
Harmonizing moments, embracing romance,
In the quiet spaces where we connect,
All our feelings and music intersect.

Rhapsodies we share in every day,
Open hearts where melodies sway,
Seconds and minutes blend in our tune,
Echoing our love under the moon.

Symphonic waves that shape our day,
Organizing moments in a musical way,
Finding our song in each sunrise glow,
Harmonizing hearts wherever we go,
In every rhythm, you're the refrain,
Always choosing you through joy and pain.

Rhythms of devotion, constant and true,
Orchestral echoes that guide me to you,
Stories in songs we write each day,
Everlasting love in every way.
