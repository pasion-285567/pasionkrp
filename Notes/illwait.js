<h2>I'll Wait for You</h2>

<p>In the quiet of dawn, where the soft light breaks,  <br>
I’ll wait for you, for the heart that aches.  <br>
Through the winds that whisper your name so true,  <br>
In every breath, I’ll wait for you.  </p>

<p>When shadows stretch across the skies,  <br>
And stars glimmer like ancient eyes,  <br>
No matter the distance, no matter how far,  <br>
I’ll wait for you beneath each star.  </p>

<p>Seasons may change, and time may bend,  <br>
But love like ours will never end.  <br>
In every moment, through night and through day,  <br>
I'll wait for you, come what may.  </p>

<p>So take your time, be steady, be free,  <br>
For love is patient, as it should be.  <br>
In the stillness, in the storm’s embrace,  <br>
I’ll wait for you, in our sacred space.</p>
