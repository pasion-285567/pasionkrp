In the quiet of dawn, where the soft light breaks
I'll wait for you, for the heart that aches
Through the winds that whisper your name so true
In every breath, I'll wait for you

When shadows stretch across the skies
And stars glimmer like ancient eyes
No matter the distance, no matter how far
I'll wait for you beneath each star

Seasons may change, and time may bend
But love like ours will never end
In every moment, through night and through day
I'll wait for you, come what may

So take your time, be steady, be free
For love is patient, as it should be
In the stillness, in the storm's embrace
I'll wait for you, in our sacred space
