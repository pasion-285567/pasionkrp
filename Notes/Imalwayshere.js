When skies grow dark and fill with rain,
I'm always here through joy or pain.
In silence deep or storms that call,
I'll be the one to break your fall.

When shadows creep and doubts arise,
I'll stand by you through lows and highs.
No road too far, no night too long,
Together, we are always strong.

Through every tear, through every smile,
I'm here for you through every mile.
No matter what life puts you through,
Remember this: I'm here for you.

When dreams seem lost, too far to see,
Just close your eyes and lean on me.
In every trial, in all you do,
Know that my heart beats strong for you.

When laughter fades, when joy feels thin,
I'll lift you up and draw you in.
With every step, no fear to face,
You'll find me here, a steady place.

So trust in this, through thick and thin,
I'll be your strength, your closest kin.
In every moment, tried and true,
Forevermore, I'm here for you.
