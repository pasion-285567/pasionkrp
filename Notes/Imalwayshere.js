<h2>I'm Always Here for You </h2>

<p>When skies grow dark and fill with rain,  <br>
I’m always here through joy or pain.  <br>
In silence deep or storms that call,  <br>
I'll be the one to break your fall.  </p>

<p>When shadows creep and doubts arise,  <br>
I’ll stand by you through lows and highs.  <br>
No road too far, no night too long,  <br>
Together, we are always strong.  </p>

<p>Through every tear, through every smile,  <br>
I’m here for you through every mile.  <br>
No matter what life puts you through,  <br>
Remember this: I’m here for you.  </p>

<p>When dreams seem lost, too far to see,  <br>
Just close your eyes and lean on me.  <br>
In every trial, in all you do,  <br>
Know that my heart beats strong for you. </p> 

<p>When laughter fades, when joy feels thin,  <br>
I’ll lift you up and draw you in.  <br>
With every step, no fear to face,  <br>
You’ll find me here, a steady place.  </p>

<p>So trust in this, through thick and thin,  <br>
I’ll be your strength, your closest kin.  <br>
In every moment, tried and true,  <br>
Forevermore, I’m here for you.</p>
