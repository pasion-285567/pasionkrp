    <h2>"Sofhia"</h2>
    <p>Soft whispers linger in the night,<br>
    Our love forever shining bright.<br>
    Fate has bound our hearts as one,<br>
    Holding on until the days are done.<br>
    In every beat, you'll always stay,<br>
    A love that time can't wash away.</p>
    
    <p>Stars above may lose their glow,<br>
    Only you will ever know<br>
    Feelings deep, a flame so true,<br>
    Holding fast to what we knew.<br>
    In my soul, your light will gleam,<br>
    Always living in my dream.</p>
    
    <p>So no matter where we roam,<br>
    Our love will always lead us home.<br>
    Falling stars may light the sky,<br>
    Holding hands as years go by.<br>
    In this life or in the next,<br>
    Always you, my heart's reflex.</p>
    
    <p>Seasons change, but love will stay,<br>
    Over mountains, far away.<br>
    Forever yours, my heart will sing,<br>
    Holding tight through everything.<br>
    In your eyes, I find my peace,<br>
    Always bound, our love's release.</p>
    
    <p>Songs of us will never fade,<br>
    Oceans deep or skies displayed.<br>
    For in your arms, I've found my place,<br>
    Holding close in sweet embrace.<br>
    In every tear, in every smile,<br>
    Always loving, mile by mile.</p>
    
    <p>Silent vows we once exchanged,<br>
    Over time, they're never changed.<br>
    Fate has written we belong,<br>
    Holding you, where love is strong.<br>
    In every breath, in every way,<br>
    Always, I will love you, stay.</p>
