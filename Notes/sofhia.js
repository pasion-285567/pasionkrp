Soft whispers linger in the night,
Our love forever shining bright.
Fate has bound our hearts as one,
Holding on until the days are done.
In every beat, you'll always stay,
A love that time can't wash away.

Stars above may lose their glow,
Only you will ever know
Feelings deep, a flame so true,
Holding fast to what we knew.
In my soul, your light will gleam,
Always living in my dream.

So no matter where we roam,
Our love will always lead us home.
Falling stars may light the sky,
Holding hands as years go by.
In this life or in the next,
Always you, my heart's reflex.

Seasons change, but love will stay,
Over mountains, far away.
Forever yours, my heart will sing,
Holding tight through everything.
In your eyes, I find my peace,
Always bound, our love's release.

Songs of us will never fade,
Oceans deep or skies displayed.
For in your arms, I've found my place,
Holding close in sweet embrace.
In every tear, in every smile,
Always loving, mile by mile.

Silent vows we once exchanged,
Over time, they're never changed.
Fate has written we belong,
Holding you, where love is strong.
In every breath, in every way,
Always, I will love you, stay.
